## About me
He began his career in 2015 at the NDC "Zubrenok" as a teacher of mathematics and computer science. To broaden his horizons, he began to study educational robotics and soon became a teacher of additional education and a curator of the Robolizer profile unit. But I didn't see myself as a teacher of one discipline, so I started studying 3D modeling and Front-end development. For the successful functioning of the specialized detachment, various training programs have been written. Currently, I continue my path in teaching the younger generation of 3d-modeling and web-layout.
But working as a teacher does not allow you to fully immerse yourself in the world of software development, so I set myself the goal of changing my occupation.
